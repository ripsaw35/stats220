# stats220

## HI THERE!

welcome to my repo, the main purpose of it is for the project 1 of my stats 220 class,

*(p.s. its very cool that were making memes, **memes** bro, like can you believe it?)*

# ahem, anyways, to pass in this project , we would have to make:
 1. a meme(*yay*)
 2. a animated gif(not sure how but ill try ‚ò∫Ô∏è)
 3. a HTML 
 4. setting up the github page.
 5. and finally, write a report
 
that basically covers what is included in this repo, but now I need to use another type of bullet point and include a link to another website, so please find below a bullet point with some emojis, and two links, one leads to the url of the github page, and one leads to the rick roll. 

## **proceed with caution. You have been warned!**

* üëΩ(bogos binted)
* [GitHub link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
* [the actual GitHub link, trust me]()
